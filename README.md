immune Guard Agent
==================

This is the agent component of the immune Guard product.
It used together with the immune Guard API Service. Further information
can be found at the [immune homepage](https://immu.ne/).

Build
-----
The service is written on Go and needs version 1.19 or later to be built.

You need to have git lfs installed for windows builds. Install with "git lfs install"
and run "git lfs pull" once and in future the next regular fetch and pull will do it.

Building the binary can be done with GNU Make:

```bash
make
```
